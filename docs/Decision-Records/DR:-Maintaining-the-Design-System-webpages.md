This is a record in the [Decision Records on Solutions Not Implemented](Decision-Records-on-Solutions-Not-Implemented).

#### Issue
#1850

#### Problem Statement
For the Design System used by the Website Team, we need a way to relay to the team what the intentions are behind the designs.

#### Potential Solution
Maintaining and keeping [Design System webpages](https://www.hackforla.org/design-system) up to date so that all developers can easily reference the website for the information

#### Feasibility Determination
This potential solution is not feasible right now because of the extra work required to maintain and keep the Design System webpages up to date. Factors that lead to this decision:
- Design system in Figma is not finished and keeps experiencing changes
- The site will always be out of date and need constant updates
- Low priority project/tech debt
